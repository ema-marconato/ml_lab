# Machine Learning for CS and AIS
Official repository for the lab sessions of the course of Machine Learning (Acc. year 2023/2024), taught by Prof. Andrea Passerini (University of Trento).

## Getting started

Make sure to install properly ``python >3.7`` on your device. Then, execute the following installation wth pip:

```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sklearn pandas
```
```
pip install jupyter
```

## Scikit-learn notebook

Make sure to clone this directory (by copying the link and using ``git clone <link>``) or download it and unzip it. Then, from your terminal change over the ``./sklearn`` directory and launch:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Make sure everything works as proper (sklearn must be updated to the latest version), otherwise for bugs and other fixes contact me.
